This project was made to learn the basics of ReactPy.

To run the project type the following commands on the terminal:

1. Activate the virtual environment.
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

2. Run the project with `gunicorn` having *reload* flag enabled.

```

Edit the files on the `components` folder to change the behavior and UI.
